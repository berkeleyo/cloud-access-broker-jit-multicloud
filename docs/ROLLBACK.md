# ROLLBACK

**Goal**: Safely revert to pre‑JIT operational access if blockers arise.

1. Re‑enable legacy standing admin group (time‑boxed, monitored).
2. Disable JIT approval flows and PIM eligibility activations.
3. Remove/disable AWS/GCP trust temporarily.
4. Announce rollback to stakeholders; extend incident post‑mortem.
5. Keep logs; schedule re‑attempt with remediations.
